# Mission-to-Mars
This project implemented web-scraping with python and jupyter notebook using webscraper library to pull data related to Mars into a centralized no-SQL database. Then using HTML the code was presented with Flask and python as a website.

## Overview
This project required pulling headlines and images from various websites about Mars. They were compiled in Mongo, a no-SQL database and presented with Flask as a website using bootstrap. The challenge was to add in four other images from another website and scrape them using looping into the database and then present them out of the database into the Flask website along with a corresponding description text.

## Results
The website was well-made and functional, with a scraping button that would re-pull the data at will and present it.
